# Collagify

## Prelude

I originally started this project during Winter 2020 as a way to practice working with Java, Spring Boot, REST API and OAuth 2.0 for my Co-op in January 2021. Fast-forward to now, developing this web application has helped me re-visit front-end essentials and explore basic web design fundamentals. It has tremendously helped me with my onboarding into my current job, and there's many things I still want to add or improve to Collagify. 

If there's any takeaways from my experience - nuturing a new skill takes time and genuine interest, and there is no better way to do it other than to practice as much as you can.

## About Collagify

Collagify is a web application that makes a collage using the album covers of your all-time favourite songs. In other words, the songs that you've listened to the most. The application makes a call to the Spotify API and extracts the image URL from the JSON response, then arranges them in a N x N square (where N is a number prompted to be inputted by the user). 

The application is currently hosted [here](https://annas-plugin.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku. Heroku provides free PaaS services but consequently results in low bandwidth. 

Comments? Questions? Suggestions? - I'd love to hear them. Feel free to make an [issue](https://github.com/atangzer/spotify-plugin/issues/new) and let me know. I'd also love to see what your collage looks like as well :)
