# Collagify

## Prelude
I originally started this project during Winter 2020 as a way to practice working with Java, Spring Boot, REST API and OAuth 2.0 for my Co-op in January 2021. Fast-forward to now, developing this web application has helped me re-visit front-end essentials and explore basic web design fundamentals. It has tremendously helped me with my onboarding into my current job, and there's many things I still want to add or improve to Collagify. 

If there's any takeaways from my experience - nuturing a new skill takes time and genuine interest, and there is no better way to do it other than to practice as much as you can.

## Documentation coming soon....I promise.
